## Improve model performance
### modal centric approach
- Increase "max_steps" or "learning_rate"

Since the wer result of each checkpoint keeps decreasing, we can see that our model is underfitting. Hence, increasing the "max_steps" or "learning_rate" in Seq2SeqTrainingArguments can improve the model.
